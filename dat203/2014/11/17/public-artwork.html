    <h3 id="the-monument-to-the-conquerors-of-space">The Monument to the Conquerors of Space</h3>
<p>The Monument to the Conquerors of Space (1964) is a monument in Moscow build in honour of Russia’s preeminence in space. In 1961 Yuri Gagarin made the first orbit around the earth and went to outer space. The monument consists of a big obelisk with a curve (110 meters high) made with titanium, with on top a rocket. The monument is to resemble the rocket and the plumes created when taking off. On the base of the monument are engravings picturing resembling the people involved in the space programm. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/DAT203_arapp_space.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The purpose of te Monument to the Conquerors of Space is to celebrate the achievements in space made by the Soviet Union. In the 60’s the Cold War was in full swing and the Soviet Union had beaten the USA in making the first steps into space. The monument was the symbolisation of these victories in the space race and functions to pride the Soviet Union achievements and celebrate the greatness of the Union.</p>

<p>The location of the monument might have been inspired by the fact that most parts of the space programm were based in these parts of the city. Korolyov, the lead engineer, lived a few blocks away. </p>

<p>The monument is a permanent building and also houses the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics. The Soviet Union build the monument, so there was no lack of authorisation. It even seems they started planning the monument 3 years before Gagarin made his orbit, which points out how important it must have seem to be a step ahead of the USA and basically ‘show off’, especially seen in the light of the Cold War and the Arms &amp; Space Race going on.</p>

<h3 id="vectorial-elevation">Vectorial Elevation</h3>
<p>Vectorial Elevation is a piece consisting of robitic search lights, which were directed by participants on the internet. The first time the work was shown was in 1999 in Mexico City to celebrat the arrival of the year 2000. It has been repeated on several locations and occasions, such as in Vancouver for the Winter Olympics in 2010. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/DAT203_arapp_vancouver.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>One of the unique aspects of this work is the scale and interaction with the public. By going to a website, everybody can create a lightsculpture and submit it to the queue, which is quite a lot of control for one of the biggest interactive artworks made. </p>

<p>By not running a preprogrammed show, but give the public control it creates a sence of participation. </p>

<p>The piece has been designed to ‘attract personal participation that creates a sense of connection, conplicity and entitlement’. By not being merely spectators people feel that they are part of something bigger and have a place. </p>

<p>The locations of the work are in a central place, closely or on location of the festivity and viewable from the surroundings (depending on the strength of the lights it can be seen from 15 km). </p>

<p>The work is a temporary installation, commissioned by organizations involved in the respecive festivity. </p>

<p>If you compare the works they’re quite different, both in forn and functionality. The Monument to the Conquerers of Space is a symbol of national pride and achievement to impress people while the Vectorial Elevation is made to make people feel part of it, give them a place in society. </p>
