  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Throughout the module we looked into a few art practises such as GPS drawing, psychogeopgraphy and music concrète. We now have been given the assignment to create an augmented reality (AR) app incorporating one of the art practises. After a bit of tinkering I came up with a few ideas and elements I could use for an app.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/DAT203_arapp_mindmap.jpg" alt="Some ideas mapped out, which might or might not make sense to other people :)" />Some ideas mapped out, which might or might not make sense to other people :) I’ll cover the two most interesting ideas I had.</p>

<p>The first one is a bit of a mix between the practises. The idea evolved around (live) image manipulation, influenced by the user input about the feeling of the area or by sound input. The user could give an input (maybe the user creates sound as input) or soundbites from the surrounding would be used for input which would be used as paramaters for an image manipulation algorithm. Besides the standaard filter effects for photo manipulation I was thinking about applying algorithms which would have a glitch effect or something like pixel sorting. </p>

<p>Pixel sorting is something I recently discovered and would like to play around with some day. Pixel sorting is the ‘invention’ of Kim Asendorf. It would be interesting to see if this could be used to express emotions and feelings, or give the image of a certain place a certain atmosphere.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/DAT203_arapp_pixelsorting.jpg" alt="An example of a pixel-sorted photo by Kim Asendorf" />

<p>The second idea had more to do with GPS drawing. The idea is to make it crowdsourced instead of drawing it on your own. The goal is to make it a group activity, which also means there has to be a ‘commitment’ as a group to create a drawing. This idea has been inspired by the <a href="http://donottouch.org">‘Do Not Touch’</a>, interactive &amp; crowdsources video where users ‘participate’ in the video with their mouse cursos. The cursor is also being recorded and added to the video. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/DAT203_arapp_donottouch.jpg" alt="A part of the 'Do Not Touch' video where the users have to create a smiley" />A part of the ‘Do Not Touch’ video where the users have to create a smiley.</p>

<p>The interesting part about crowdsources artwork is that individual choices of everybody influence the collective outcome. This also reflects how we live together as humans in communities. We all make our own individual choices, but everything has impact on all the other individuals, direct or indirect and the collective whole. But we won’t get to philosofical now :).</p>

<p>I struggled a bit with the AR implementation , the initial ideas I had didn’t really make use of any augmented reality features. So the requirement of AR has been the reason why I had to drop quite a few of ideas.
The 0ne idea I could fit with AR was the crowdsourced GPS drawing, so that’s the concept I picked to build a prototype for. </p>

<p>The goal of the app is to create a collective embodiment of the collaborative experience of the environment and also make people interact with each other and work towards a collective goal. In the process of this people will also interact and be influenced by the terrain and environment, as with the original form of GPS drawing.</p>

<p>As you can see the app itself consists of the camera view and a (ugly) button to add a new point to the data set. The image target is being displayed in front of the camera, where you can see some testdata I’ve put into the database. It’s supposed to look like a question mark, I might have forgot a few points :-P The green dots it the data set being visualised, the red dot is the current position (when available). 
<img src="/assets/images/DAT203_arapp_screenshot.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This is a screenshot of the app in function. You can see how they display the dots. </p>

<h3 id="technical-implementation">Technical Implementation</h3>
<p>THe prototype consists of two parts; the app for android itself and a server application. The android app is build with Unity3D and Vuforia, an augmented reailty toolkit. Developing in Unity3D has been a bit of a jump in at the deep end with 0 experience in either Unity or C#. </p>

<p>On the server side I have written a Node.js app linked with a PostgreSQL, all running on Heroku. For this purpose websockets would have been a good way for the client/server communication but after looking into it I found it was too complicated to implement in the client side (at least for someone without any C# experience :) ) and because I was building a prototype where performance isn’t the biggest priority I decided to go with an easier solution. The server has routes for two url’s; ending with <code>/db</code> and <code>/pos/(lat),(long)</code>. </p>

<p>The first route queries the database and pulls all the locations out of the database and returns a webpage with the data in JSON. With the second URL the latitude and longitude coordinates are included into the URL. The server grabs this as a string, splits it and inserts it into the database.</p>

<p>In Unity the request go through a WWW-object, which is used to load the content of a webpage. When requesting the locations, it receives the JSON in the webpage which is then further parsed in Unity. When submitting data it doesn’t receive any data, it is just being used to send the request to the server, which makes the whole implementation of the server/client a lot simpler than using websockets. </p>

<p>After the JSON is parsed it processes the values, scales them accordingly to fit the image target and is then displayed with dots.</p>

<h3 id="options-for-expansionimprovement">Options for expansion/improvement</h3>
<p>It’s still a prototype, there are quite a lot of things which could be added or improved (besides more prettyness in the UI ed).</p>

<ul>
  <li>If this would become a real app it wouldn’t be very easy to use if it displays everything in one big map (but if it was, it might also look quite interesting? Or display all the drawings as a big drawing wall?). Probably there needs to be a feature which enables you to select different ‘projects’. </li>
  <li>It would be cool if you could pick unique image targets for your drawing/project, improving the relation between the environment and the artwork</li>
  <li>The server doesn’t work very effective with polling everytime. A better technology like websockets might be a good improvement</li>
  <li>Include altitude into data so the data becomes more of a point cloud</li>
  <li>The scaling of the location of the points can be improved. It is dinamic, but still not flawless. Also the size of the dots need to be scaled as well.</li>
</ul>
